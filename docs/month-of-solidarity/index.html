        <p>"Month of Solidarity with Political Prisoners" is a dynamic initiative aimed at exposing the suppression of democracy and human rights in Russia under Putin's regime. Featuring exhibitions, discussions, and educational sessions in Amsterdam and The Hague, held from 1 June until 6 July, this program seeks to mobilise international support for Russian political prisoners. It addresses decades of political persecution and opposes state propaganda by showcasing the ongoing resistance in Russia and among the diaspora.
