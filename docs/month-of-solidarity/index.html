        "Month of Solidarity with Political Prisoners" is a dynamic initiative
        aimed at exposing the suppression of democracy and human rights in
        Russia under Putin's regime. Featuring exhibitions, discussions, and
        educational sessions in Amsterdam and The Hague, held from 1 June until
        6 July, this program seeks to mobilise international support for Russian
        political prisoners. It addresses decades of political persecution and
        opposes state propaganda by showcasing the ongoing resistance in Russia
        and among the diaspora. By joining, participants can help advance
        transparency, justice, and democratic governance in Russia, challenging
        the authoritarian shadow cast by Putin's government.
