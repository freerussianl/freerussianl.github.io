        <h1>Support the Ukrainian manifestation</h1>
        <p>We are from Russia, and we stand with Ukraine #standWithUkraine</p>
        <p>From the very beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has been waging war not only against #Ukraine but also against the foundations of a world order based on international law. For three years, Ukraine has been holding back the largest aggression in #Europe since World War II. Nearly a million Ukrainian defenders and civilians have been killed or maimed. Thousands have been abducted and tortured in Russian prisons. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian children have been forcibly taken out of the country. Millions of lives have been shattered forever.</p>
        <p>Ukraine needs our #support now more than ever. Any attempt to impose an unjust peace on Ukraine, one that legitimizes the occupation of its territories, will send a signal to aggressors worldwide: violence and war crimes pay off. History shows that appeasing an aggressor does not lead to peace but to new warsâ€”just as it did in 1938 after the Munich Agreement.</p>
        <p>If Ukraine does not receive sufficient support, the #war could spread further. Russia has long been waging a #hybrid war against Europe, and its leadership openly threatens neighboring countries. It is crucial to understand: if Ukraine falls, Moldova, Georgia, and other countries could be next.</p>
        <p>That is why helping Ukraine is not just about supporting one country. It is about defending the international order, European security, and the principles on which a stable world is built.</p>
        <p>And, simply on a human level, we must help those whom an aggressor is trying to destroy just because it wants to.</p>
