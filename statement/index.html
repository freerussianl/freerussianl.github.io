      <h1>FreeRussiaNL statement on proposed visa ban for all Russian citizens</h1>
      <p>
          <a href="./nl.html">Nederlandse versie</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        We are closely following the news on the proposed visa bans for citizens
        of the Russian Federation and the discussion going on about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        First of all, we as FreeRussiaNL would like to make it clear that our
        humanitarian work remains the same - we will continue to provide all
        assistance to Ukraine, the country defending itself in this murderous
        war unleashed on it by the Russian regime. We fully understand the
        feelings and emotions of Ukrainians and of President Zelensky. They face
        every day what we can hardly imagine in our worst nightmares.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also understand the position of the countries that border Russia and
        want to protect their borders. Russia has become a terrorist state,
        killing hostages at home as well as people in other countries. The
        desire to defend oneself against it is natural.
      </p>

      <p>
        We, our community, live in the Netherlands, a country whose social
        structure and statehood are based on humanistic values and respect for
        human life. We share these values. We are against inciting hatred and
        dividing people in any way, including on the basis of nationality.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are the values that also guide the activists of the anti-war
        movement in Russia. Because of the new Iron Curtain, unprecedented
        repressions and censorship, the voices of these Russians are often not
        heard, but they do exist. These people did not choose the current
        regime, their country of birth or passports nor did they have a choice
        of a nationality. Many of them are now risking their freedom and their
        lives by doing everything in their power to stop the war. The situation
        in Russia today is such that even "public prisoners" (such as Alexei
        Navalny, Sasha Skochilenko, Alexei Gorinov, Ilya Yashin, Vladimir
        Kara-Murza) face torture and health risks.
      </p>

      <p>
        For ordinary activists who are not in the public eye the danger is many
        times higher.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anti-war activity and activists are focused on European values and are
        fighting for the day when Russia will become a modern European country,
        safe for its own citizens and for other countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is why the European Union's response to the proposed
        nationality-based visa ban is so important for anti-war activists and
        campaigners. Propaganda in Russia has long exploited claims of
        "Russophobia" and human rights abuses in Europe. Even serious
        consideration of such visa bans will confirm their propagandistic claims
        and demotivate and discourage anti-war initiatives inside and outside
        Russia.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of our activities is to support anti-war movements and therefore we
        are deeply concerned about initiatives that could harm them.
      </p>

      <p>
        We call on Western society, European leaders and citizens to not punish
        those who oppose the regime for those who are guilty of war crimes.
